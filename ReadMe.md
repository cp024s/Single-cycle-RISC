# Single Stage Pipelined RISC Processor in Verilog


## Overview

This repository contains the Verilog implementation of a single-stage pipelined RISC processor. The processor is designed based on the Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) architecture, providing a simple yet efficient computing solution.

## Features

- Single-stage pipeline design for improved instruction throughput.
- RISC architecture for simplicity and ease of understanding.
- Verilog implementation for FPGA or ASIC synthesis.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Verilog source code files.
- `testbench/`: Testbench files for simulation.
- `docs/`: Documentation and additional resources.

## Simulation Results

## Simulation Waveform

## Documentation
For detailed information on the architecture, instruction set, and usage, refer to the documentation.
